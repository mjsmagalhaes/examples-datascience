# examples-datascience

My data science experiences.

## Folder Structure:

- dslib
  - python packages used to analyse the data
- data
  - datasets
- other folders (with dataset names)
  - they contain scripts used in the analysis of that specific dataset

## Some Projects in this Repository

Those projects are in better shape but still considered a WIP.

- World of Warcraft Log
- Forest Fires
