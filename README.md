# examples-datascience

My data science adventures.

## Folder Structure:

- dslib
  - python packages used to analyse the data
- data
  - datasets
- other folders (with dataset names)
  - they contain scripts used in the analysis of that specific dataset

### Notebook Names

- example\_

  - An example of how to do something

- data\_

  - Those notebooks are about datasets (usually in the data folder unless when too big to add to git like WoWs).

- course\_
  - Notebooks created for courses exercices.

## Some Projects in this Repository

Those projects are in better shape but still considered a WIP.
